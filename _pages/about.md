My name is Marco Favorito. 
I'm a [PhD student](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en/users/marco%20favorito) 
at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home)
([DIAG](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en)).
I work in the research group [WhiteMech](https://whitemech.github.io/),
under the supervision of prof. [Giuseppe De Giacomo](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~degiacom/).

My research interests are in the area of Artificial Intelligence. 
In particular, I'm interested in how to improve the interaction between
Formal Methods and Machine Learning, especially in the context of
decision making, in order to take the best of both worlds.

I've got a MSc. and BSc. in Engineering in Computer Science, in the same university.

Previously, I was a full-time Machine Learning Engineer at [Fetch.ai](https://fetch.ai/).
I am one of the main contributors of the [AEA framework](https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/),
which empowers developers to build decentralized autonomous software
that trades on blockchains and perform other useful tasks for their owner.
From time to time I still contribute to [Fetch.ai](https://fetch.ai/) [projects](https://github.com/fetchai/).
