My name is Marco Favorito. 
I'm a [PhD student](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en/users/marco%20favorito) 
at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home)
([DIAG](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en)).
I work in the research group [WhiteMech](https://whitemech.github.io/),
under the supervision of prof. [Giuseppe De Giacomo](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~degiacom/).

My research interests are in the area of Artificial Intelligence. 
In particular, I'm interested in how to improve the interaction between
Formal Methods and Machine Learning, especially in the context of
decision making, in order to take the best of both worlds.

I've got a MSc. and BSc. in Engineering in Computer Science, in the same university.

I'm also a contributor to [Fetch.AI](https://fetch.ai/) [projects](https://github.com/fetchai/).
