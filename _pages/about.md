My name is Marco Favorito. 
Currently, I work as a researcher in the [Applied Research Team of the Bank of Italy](https://bankit.art/). 

I obtained my PhD in 2022 from [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home)
([DIAG](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en)), where I worked in the research group [WhiteMech](https://whitemech.github.io/),
under the supervision of prof. [Giuseppe De Giacomo](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~degiacom/).

<!--
My research interests are in the area of Artificial Intelligence. 
In particular, I am interested in how to improve the interaction between
Formal Methods and Machine Learning, especially in the context of
decision making, in order to take the best of both worlds.
Among my areas of research, there are: Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning,
Automata Theory, (Finite) Temporal Synthesis, Planning for Temporal Goals, 
and Multi-Agent Systems.

Previously, I was a full-time Machine Learning Engineer at [Fetch.ai](https://fetch.ai/).
I am one of the main contributors of the [AEA framework](https://valory-xyz.github.io/open-aea/)
([original repo](https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/), [fork](https://github.com/valory-xyz/open-aea)),
which empowers developers to build decentralized autonomous software
that trades on blockchains and perform other useful tasks for their owner.

I have got both a MSc. and BSc. in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza University, in 2016 and 2018 respectively.
